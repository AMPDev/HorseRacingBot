CoinChat.org Bot

The main bot is in HorseRacingBot.js, but it requires a .dat file as well. There is an example .dat file,
called HorseRacingBot.dat included in this repo.

Feel free to fork and pull request, as the goal of having this open-sourced is to provide easy-to-use and
up-to-date bot code for CoinChat.org
